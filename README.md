# Metal-Part-Rust-Detector
This project is a Streamlit web app that detects rust on metal surfaces using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can upload an image, and the model predicts whether rust is present or not, displaying the result and confidence level. Itâ€™s simple, fast, and effective for visual rust inspection.
